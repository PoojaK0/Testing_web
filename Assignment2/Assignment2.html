			<img src='s.jpg' width='250' height='400' align='right'>
			<p><font size='4' >You are the only one who knows yourself best. Everyone around you has 
			different things to tell about you, but only you know your true self. There are billions of 
			people on this planet, and every person has a different purpose. Each person finds their 
			mission differently and has a different journey. Thus, when I write about myself, I write 
			about my journey and what makes the person I am because of the trip. I try to be myself,
			be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, 
			live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make.
			I am a student who lives in Ghaziabad with my family.<br><br>
			My name is Pooja Kumari.
			I've completed my graduation in BCA from IMS Ghaziabad
			and currently I'm Pursuing MCA from KIET Group of Institutions.<br>
			I'm an optimistic, detail oriented person with quick learning capabilities. 
			These are my strengths and as for my weakness, I've the fear of public speaking 
			and I find it challenging whenever I'm talking to someone having higher authority than me,
			specially in English, I start stuttering and sometimes mispronounce some words as well. 
			But I'm trying to overcome this fear of mine by talking to my friends and batchmates in English,
			by reading more books and sometimes talking to myself in English.<br><br>
			I like reading books and comics, watching anime and sketching, and sometimes playing puzzle 
			games.I want to become a software developer and lately I've been practicing and 
			improving my coding skills on different platforms.
		    <br><br>
			My parents have always supported my dreams and aspirations. 
			According to them, the only way to achieve all your goals is to
			work very hard and never give up on them.
			They have never imposed themselves and demanded
			that any of their children become what they want us. Instead, 
			they wanted my siblings and me to choose careers and a 
			life that will give us joy and stability.
