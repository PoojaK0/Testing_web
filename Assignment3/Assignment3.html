                <p>The introduction typically describes the scope of the document and gives a 
                    brief explanation or a summary of the document. It may also explain certain 
                    elements that are important to the document. The readers can thus have an idea
                     about the following text before they actually start reading it.
                    The University of Toronto provides advice about how to write essays:
                    A good introduction should identify your topic, provide essential 
                    context, and indicate your particular focus in the essay. It also 
                    needs to engage your readers interest.
                    Some authors write their introduction first, while others prefer to
                     leave it for a later stage in the writing process; another option 
                     is to start with a rough draft introduction, and then come back to
                      finish it after the body text is done.
