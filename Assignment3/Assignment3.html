                <h2 id="me">Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Pooja Kumari.
			I've completed my graduation in BCA from IMS Ghaziabad
			and currently I'm Pursuing MCA from KIET Group of Institutions.<br>
			I'm an optimistic, detail oriented person with quick learning capabilities. 
			These are my strengths and as for my weakness, I've the fear of public speaking 
			and I find it challenging whenever I'm talking to someone having higher authority than me,
			specially in English, I start stuttering and sometimes mispronounce some words as well. 
			But I'm trying to overcome this fear of mine by talking to my friends and batchmates in English,
			by reading more books and sometimes talking to myself in English.<br><br>
			I like reading books and comics, watching anime and sketching, and sometimes playing puzzle 
			games.I want to become a software developer and lately I've been practicing and 
			improving my coding skills on different platforms.
